# go-base64-tools

There are many Go packages for doing base64 related things. This one is ours.

## Install

You will need to have both `Go` and the `make` programs installed on your computer. Assuming you do just type:

```
make bin
```

All of this package's dependencies are bundled with the code in the `vendor` directory.
